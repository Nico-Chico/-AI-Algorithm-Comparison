Our project is study differents

Optimization Algorithms using AI:
==================================
- Particle Swarm Optimization
- Simulated Annealing
- Hill Climbing
- Genetics Algorithms 
- A*


Problems topics of the Study
==========================

- First of all we are going to test this algorithms efficiency with differents mathematical functions.
Valley-shaped function like Rosembrock, Many Local Minima functions like Levi.



Later we gonna find a practical problem and we will use our algorithms to solve it.

Example:
- Energy Supply System

    We are going to study the optimization for a power station, which will provide energy to a enterprise and differentes houses,
studying the best way to reduce the cost of the suppliment and looking for the benefits.
